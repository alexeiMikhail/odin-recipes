            Elevate your sandwich game using fire! 
        </p>
        <p>Melty gooey goodness.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>bread of choice</li>
            <li>cheese of choice</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>mayo (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a pan on the stovetop to low-medium heat. You may also use a grill or griddle if you prefer.</li>
            <li>Remove two slices of bread from packaging and stage them on a plate or paper towel. If you don't have access to either, then you may stage
                directly on the countertop, but in that case you will have to wipe down your workspace at the end.</li>
            <li>Butter one side of one slice of bread. Then place it facedown in the hot pan.</li>
            <li>If you want to use mayo, spread it directly onto the bread currently sizzling in the pan.</li>
            <li>Add one or more slices of cheese to the bread in the pan.</li>
            <li>If you're using mayo, go ahead and add it to the second slice of bread. Then place it squarely mayo-side-down on top of the bread in the pan.</li>
            <li>Add butter to the top bread. If it won't spread, then hold the butter to the next step.</li>
            <li>Flip your sandwich using a spatula or fork. If you weren't able to spread the butter in the last step, place it directly in the pan and 
                swirl the sandwich around in the melted butter.</li>
            <li>Once browned on both sides, remove the sandwich from the pan and return to staging area.</li>
            <li>Using your pocket knife, cut the sandwich diagonally into two triangular halves.</li>
            <li>Put it in your face hole and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
